##How to Run
####Using Console
Copy all of the code in "quizletbot.js".
Next, go to the quizlet space race game and go do "inspect element"
Go on the tab that says "console"
Paste the code and press enter.

####Using Tampermonkey
Go to the "spaceracebot.js" file and click on "Raw".
Tampermonkey will then ask you if you want to install it.
Just click install.
Now whenever you visit a quizlet space race game, this bot will be activated.

####Usage
The inputbox will automatically fill itself with the answers.
All you have to do is press enter many times.

Here's what it looks like approximately after 1hr of using the bot.

This bot can theoretically run for ever without dying. The only things that can possibly cause it to lose a life is:
- lag
- human intervention

I only stopped the bot after 1 hr because I got bored.
